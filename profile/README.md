## üöÄ Overview

Smart Scroll is a macOS utility that gives you **complete control over scrolling behavior**. Instead of being limited to the system‚Äôs default scroll speed and acceleration, Smart Scroll lets you fine-tune how your trackpad, Magic Mouse, or regular mouse responds to scrolling. You can adjust speed, acceleration, smoothness, and even enable unique scrolling features not offered by macOS.

Whether you‚Äôre reading long articles, navigating code in an editor, or scrolling large design canvases, Smart Scroll helps you work more comfortably and efficiently. It supports both vertical and horizontal scrolling, has presets for different apps, and includes advanced features like *Grab Scroll* (drag the page like on a touch device) and *Vector Scroll* for smooth precision control.

This tool is especially valuable for professionals working long hours on Macs: designers, developers, researchers, and anyone tired of jerky or too-fast scroll behavior. Smart Scroll turns scrolling into a customizable, smooth, and ergonomic experience.
